# SubnetCalculator üåê
**SubnetCalculator** is a python script which allows you to perform three main tasks, namely:
- Determine the **network address**, the **broadcast address** and the **host id range** from an IP address and its respective subnet mask.<br>
- Divise a given network in a specific number of sub-networks(**FLSM**).
- Divise a given network into sub-networks using a number of users(**VLSM**: more convenient than FLSM) 
It is made up of 3 classes(GetNetHost.py, FLSM.py and VLSM.py).
Feel free to read the READ.me file for a better understanding.
